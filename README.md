**Project Description: Simple Web Calculator**

**Overview:**
The Simple Web Calculator is a basic calculator application built for web browsers using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with a straightforward interface to perform arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Key Features:**

1. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   The calculator features a clean and intuitive user interface. Buttons for numbers (0-9) and common operators (+, -, *, /) are displayed prominently, making it easy for users to input calculations.

2. **Real-time Display:**
   The calculator provides a real-time display of user input and results. As users click on numbers and operators, the input is shown on the display screen. When the equal (=) button is pressed, the calculator evaluates the expression and displays the result instantly.

3. **Basic Arithmetic Operations:**
   Users can perform basic arithmetic calculations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator follows the standard order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS - Brackets, Indices/Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction) to ensure accurate calculations.

4. **Clear Functionality:**
   To enhance user experience, a clear (C) button is implemented to reset the calculator. This allows users to quickly clear their input and start a new calculation.

**Technologies Used:**

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):**
  HTML is used to create the structure of the calculator, defining elements such as buttons and display screen.

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):**
  CSS is applied to style the calculator, providing visual appeal and ensuring a responsive layout on different devices.

- **JavaScript:**
  JavaScript is utilized to add interactivity to the calculator. It captures user input, performs calculations, and updates the display dynamically without the need for page reloads.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate fundamental web development skills. By creating a simple calculator, developers gain hands-on experience with HTML for creating web elements, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for implementing logic and interactivity. This project serves as an excellent starting point for beginners to understand the basics of front-end web development.

**Learning Outcomes:**
Through this project, developers learn about event handling in JavaScript, basic DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation, and the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create functional and interactive web applications. Additionally, developers gain a better understanding of user experience design by creating an intuitive interface for performing calculations.

**Future Enhancements:**
Future enhancements to this project could include adding advanced functions (such as square root, exponentiation, trigonometric functions), implementing keyboard support for input, and improving the calculator's visual design. These enhancements would elevate the calculator's functionality and user experience.

Overall, the Simple Web Calculator project serves as a foundation for understanding essential web development concepts and encourages further exploration and learning in the field of web technologies.
